		<h1>Project 2 Reflection</h1>
		<p>For project 2, I chose to redesign The Pixie Project's website. My goal with the redesign was to simplify the appearance, as well as the amount of content present on their current website. I sought to do this with a single page, smooth-scrolling system and a friendly, limited color palette with cute illustrations to match. The details should be subtle, but clever and cute. The nevigation needed to simplified to more easily direct visitors to the most important information.<br><br>
		With these things in mind, I searched codepen for some basic structures which would suit the needs of the project. I was able to find code which looked wonderful, but would eventually break after adjusting, and adding the content I needed. Because of this, I scrapped 3 different versions of the website completely and started from scratch. I really wanted to challenge myself to build the website from the ground up with a basic grid structure. This worked up until a point, and then I needed to scrap many elements once again. The javascript portions were tripping me up, and breaking the code in some way or another.<br><br>
		After all this, I found a simple, smooth scroll nav code on codepen which perfectly fit my needs, and merged my existing code and content into this structure. With some tweaking, and styling, it resulted in a website pretty close to my original vision for the redesign. If I could refine it further, I'd want to add more illustrations and fun interactivity to make it look less bare. I might try some different color palettes as well for better readability and contrast. I would also like to add some sort of parallax element. Overall, I'm pretty happy with the result.
